Tissue was dissected to include all vascular layers and divided into four 50 mg pieces. Samples were then placed in digestion solution containing Liberase TM (10.4 U/mL working concentration, Roche) and elastase (8 U/mL, Sigma) and finely minced. Following 60 minutes of digestion at 37\u00b0C, digestates were filtered through a 70 \u03bcmol/L strainer, centrifuged and resuspended with fresh cold HBSS. Samples were sorted with FACS using Calcein green (ThermoFisher) for live/dead discrimination. Samples were immediately processed using a 10x Genomics microfluidics chip to generate barcoded Gel Bead-In Emulsions (GEMs) according to manufacturer protocols. Individual sample libraries were generated from single cell GEM captures using the Chromium 3' version 3 library prep protocol (10X Genomics). QC was performed following cDNA generation and final library construction.</LIBRARY_CONSTRUCTION_PROTOCOL></Library_descriptor><Bioproject>PRJNA986892</Bioproject><Biosample>SAMN35881900</Biosample>  ",

Girls and women with Turner syndrome have a variety of phenotypes. Of interest to this study is aortopathy, including bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) and thoracic aortic dilation (TAD) in which we know that 25 - 50% of girls with Turner syndrome are born with.  The aorta is the main artery that conducts the blood out of the heart. The aortic valve guards the entrance to the aorta. When the aortic valve has two leaflets instead of the usual three it is called a BAV. BAV is more common than all other congenital heart defects combined. BAV commonly causes obstructions to blood flow out of the heart or become leaky over time. BAV often occurs in combination with TAD. In Turner syndrome, TADs are increased 50-100 fold compared to the general population. Currently, there are no effective approaches or pre-surgical treatments for...
