Automated RBC parameters indicated macrocytosis, hypochromasia, increases in the red cell distribution width coefficient of variation (RDW-CV) and red cell distribution width standard deviation (RDW-SD), and a mild reticulocytosis. In addition, the hematology analyzer reported the flag �RBC Abn Distribution.� The RBC volume histogram displayed a distribution curve shifting to the right, consistent with the finding of an increased mean corpuscular volume (MCV). A blood film stained with Wright-Giemsa identified polychromasia (2-7 per 1000� magnification field), stomatocytosis with an average of 27 stomatocytes per 100 erythrocytes (27%), numerous knizocytes, and large platelet clumps in the feathered edge, indicating a falsely low automated platelet count. Presented with lethargy, anorexia, vomiting, episodes of weakness, and suspected collapse. As a result of clinical, biochemical, and imaging findings, the animal was treated for acute pancreatitis. The dog had been diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) 1 year earlier. Five months prior to presentation, the dog was diagnosed with primary hypothyroidism with a serum total thyroxine (T4) concentration of 12 nmol/L (reference interval [RI] 13-52 nmol/L) and a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration of 2.80 ng/mL (RI 0-0.41 ng/mL).",1
