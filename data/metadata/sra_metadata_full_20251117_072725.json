The aims of the study are to test the hypothesis that dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) has a substantial genetic basis and to evaluate the effectiveness of a family communication intervention in improving the uptake of preventive screening and surveillance in at-risk first-degree relatives. The Study goal was to recruit 1,300 individuals (600 non-Hispanic African ancestry, 600 non-Hispanic European ancestry, and 100 Hispanic; 50% female) meeting rigorous diagnostic criteria for idiopathic DCM (probands) and 2,600 of their relatives. The probands were inpatients or outpatients identified by heart failure and cardiac transplant... (for more see dbGaP study page.)",
