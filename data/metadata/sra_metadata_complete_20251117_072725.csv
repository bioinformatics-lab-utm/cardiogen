The aims of the study are to test the hypothesis that dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) has a substantial genetic basis and to evaluate the effectiveness of a family communication intervention in improving the uptake of preventive screening and surveillance in at-risk first-degree relatives. The Study goal was to recruit 1,300 individuals (600 non-Hispanic African ancestry, 600 non-Hispanic European ancestry, and 100 Hispanic; 50% female) meeting rigorous diagnostic criteria for idiopathic DCM (probands) and 2,600 of their relatives. The probands were inpatients or outpatients identified by heart failure and cardiac transplant...
